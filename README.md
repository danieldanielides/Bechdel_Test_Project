Bechdel Test

Let's use data visualization to evaluate gender and race representation in movies.

Welcome to our next project “Next Bechdel”: Visualizing Race and Gender Representation In American Movies.

In this project we’ll use data visualization techniques to analyze how the top 50 movies of 2016 performed according to the [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) and other representation-based tests.

The Bechdel-Wallace Test — often abbreviated to the “Bechdel Test” — evaluates movies based on two simple questions:

1. Does the movie have at least two named female characters?
2. And do those characters have at least one conversation that is not about a man?
